Root-level conftest.py for shared test fixtures.

Currently empty - reserved for future cross-stack fixtures that are
shared between backend and frontend tests (e.g., E2E test fixtures,
shared test data, API base URLs, etc.).

Backend-specific fixtures are in tests/backend/conftest.py.
Frontend-specific fixtures will go in tests/frontend/conftest.py.
